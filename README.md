A reliable transaction based state management library for Typescript.

This is a very early version. The API is in constant flux at the moment.

The main goals of this yet-another-state-management-library are:

- Make it more difficult to cause accidentally race conditions and other common state management issues.
- Abortable, roll-backable asynchronous operations as first-class citizens.
- Monitorable and serializable state + support development tools e.g. Redux Devtools
- Easy to use and easy to reason the application logic.

Examples will follow.

Cheers,
Ilkka
